# FPGA-3-Stage-RISC-V-Pipeline
Aim

The objective of this project is to implement an FPGA-based RISC processor that performs the three primary stages of a pipeline: Fetch, Decode, and Execute.

Procedure

Instruction Input: A 32-bit instruction is fetched from a general-purpose register.
Logical Operation: The ALU performs a register-based logical operation as per the instruction.
Result Storage: The result of the operation is stored in the address specified within the instruction.
System Demonstration: The implementation demonstrates that a RISC processor can be synthesized on an FPGA.

Software and Hardware
